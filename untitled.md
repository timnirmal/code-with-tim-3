Cloud Computing

It's the delivery of computing services over the internet.

These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

Payment:

* Lower your operating costs.
* Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
* Scale as your business needs change.

Cloud Computing Advantages:

* **Reliability**: Depending on the service-level agreement that you choose, your cloud-based applications can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime even when things go wrong.
* **Scalability**: Applications in the cloud can be scaled in two ways, while taking advantage of autoscaling:
  * _Vertically_: Computing capacity can be increased by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
  * _Horizontally_: Computing capacity can be increased by adding instances of a resource, such as adding more virtual machines to your configuration.
* **Elasticity**: Cloud-based applications can be configured to always have the resources they need.
* **Agility**: Cloud-based resources can be deployed and configured quickly as your application requirements change.
* **Geo-distribution**: Applications and data can be deployed to regional datacenters around the globe, so your customers always have the best performance in their region.
* **Disaster recovery**: By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your applications with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event that disaster should occur.
