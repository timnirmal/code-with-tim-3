# Stack

A stack is a data structure that uses two main methods to manipulate data:

* Push: adds a new piece of data in the stack.
* Pop: removes the last piece of data added.

In addition, there is another useful method that is usually implemented in a stack:

* Top: returns the last element added, without removing it.
