# String Manipulation

A string is a sequence of character.  Null character based terminated array of characters to store and manipulate strings are termed as _C Strings._ ANSI standard C++ introduces a new class called **string** which is an improvised version of C strings in several ways.

### C Style String

The C style string belongs to C language and continues to support in C++ also strings in C are the one-dimensional array of characters which gets terminated by \0 \(null character\). The C++ compiler automatically places the \0 at the end of the string when it initializes the array.

```cpp
char ch[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
```

### String Class

The string class is huge and includes many constructors, member functions, and operators.

Programmers may use the constructors, operators and member functions to achieve the following:

* Creating string objects
* Reading string objects from keyboard
* Displaying string objects to the screen
* Finding a substring from a string
* Modifying string
* Adding objects of string
* Comparing strings
* Accessing characters of a string
* Obtaining the size or length of a string, etc...
